XModel loader
The model loader does not support matrix calculations (translation, rotation, scaling). The matrix is simply ignored. As a result, a model that has scaling in the X file is NOT scaled in the engine.

LOD
The Level Of Detail is supposed to make the terrain render a lot faster, but it could have been more efficient. Due to inefficiency issues, the optimization is not sufficient.
Restitching between two levels of details does not work perfectly, the terrain has some holes.

Collision
In some cases, collision does not work properly, and the two objects get stuck together.

Frustum Culling
Frustum calculations for certain positions does not work. The culling is disabled in the current version. It will be enabled as soon as it is fixed.
